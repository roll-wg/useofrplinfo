   <abstract>
      <t>
        This document looks at different data flows through LLN (Low-Power and Lossy Networks) where RPL
        (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is used to establish routing.
        The document enumerates the cases where RFC 6553, RFC 6554 and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required.
        This analysis provides the basis on which to design efficient compression of these headers.
        This document updates RFC 6553 adding a change to the RPL Option Type. Additionally, this document updates
        RFC 6550 to indicate about this change and updates RFC8138 as well to consider the new Option Type
        when RPL Option is decompressed.

          <section title="Introduction">
             <t>
               RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)
               <xref target="RFC6550"/> is a routing protocol for
                constrained networks. RFC 6553 <xref target="RFC6553"/>
                defines the "RPL option" (RPI), carried within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
                header to                          quickly identify
                inconsistencies (loops) in the routing topology. RFC 6554 <xref
                target="RFC6554"/> defines the "RPL Source Route Header" (RH3), an
                IPv6 Extension Header to deliver datagrams within a RPL
                routing domain, particularly in non-storing mode.
             </t>
             <t>
                These various items are referred to as RPL artifacts, and
                they are seen on all of the data-plane traffic that occurs in
                RPL routed networks; they do not in general appear on the RPL
                control plane traffic at all which is mostly hop-by-hop
                traffic (one exception being DAO messages in non-storing mode).
             </t>
             <t>
               It has become clear from attempts to do multi-vendor
               interoperability, and from a desire to compress as many of
               the above artifacts as possible that not all implementors
               agree when artifacts are necessary, or when they can be safely
               omitted, or removed.
             </t>
             <t>
               An interim meeting went through the 24 cases defined here to
               discover if there were any shortcuts, and this document is the
               result of that discussion.  This document clarifies what is the correct and
               the incorrect behaviour.

          of each node.  If the packet must traverse multiple hops, then it
          must be decapsulated at each hop, and then re-encapsulated again
          in a similar fashion.

          <section title="Updates to RFC 6553">
          <t>
          This modification is required to be able to send, for example,
          IPv6 packets from a RPL-aware-leaf to a not-RPL-aware node through Internet (see <xref target="sm-Ral2i" />),

          <xref target="RFC6553"/> states as showed below, that in the Option Type field of the RPL Option
          header, the two high order bits MUST be set to '01' and the third bit is equal to '1'.
          The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node MUST discard the packet
          if it doesn't recognize the option type,
          and the third bit indicates that the Option Data may change en route.
          The remaining bits serve as the option type.

          <t>
          Recent changes in
          <xref target="RFC8200"/> (section 4, page 8), states: "it is now
          expected that nodes along a packet's delivery path only examine and
          process the Hop-by-Hop Options header if explicitly configured to
          do so". Processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options header (by IPv6 intermediate nodes) is now optional,
          but if they are configured to process the header,
          and if such nodes encounter an option with the first two bits set to 01,
          they will drop the packet (if they conform to <xref target="RFC8200"/>).
          Host systems should do the same, irrespective of the configuration.
          </t>
          <t>
          Based on That, if an IPv6 (intermediate) node (RPL-not-capable) receives a packet with an
          RPL Option, it should ignore the HBH RPL option
          (skip over this option and continue processing the header). This is relevant, as we mentioned previously, in the case that
          we have a flow from RPL-aware-leaf to Internet (see <xref target="sm-Ral2i" />).
          </t>
          <t>
           Thus, this document updates the Option Type field to:
           the two high order bits MUST be set to '00'
           and the third bit is equal to '1'.
           The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node MUST
           skip over this option and continue processing the header
           (<xref target="RFC8200"/> Section 4.2)
           if it doesn't recognize the option type,
           and the third bit continues to be set to indicate that the Option
           Data may change en route. The remaining bits serve as the option type and remain as 0x3.
           This ensures that a packet that leaves the RPL domain of an LLN (or that
           leaves the LLN entirely) will not be discarded when it contains the
           [RFC6553] RPL Hop-by-Hop option known as RPI.
          </t>
          <t>
           This is a significant update to <xref target="RFC6553"/>. [RFCXXXX] represents this document.

            This change creates a flag day for existing networks which are
            currently using 0x63 as the RPI value.  A move to 0x23 will not
            be understood by those networks.  It is suggested that
            implementations accept both 0x63 and 0x23 when
            processing.
          </t>
          <t>
            When forwarding packets, implementations SHOULD use
            the same value as it was received (This is required because,
            RPI type code can not be changed by <xref target="RFC8200"/>).
            It allows to the network to be incrementally upgraded,
            and for the DODAG root to know which parts of the network are upgraded.
          </t>
          <t>
            When originating new packets,
            implementations SHOULD have an option to determine which value to

            described below.

        <section title="Updates to RFC 6550: Indicating the new RPI in the DODAG Configuration Option Flag. ">
          <t>
            In order to avoid a flag day caused by lack of interoperation
            between new RPI (0x23) and old RPI (0x63) nodes, when there is a
            mix of new nodes and old nodes, the new nodes may be put into a
            compatibility mode until all of the old nodes are replaced or
            upgraded.
          </t>
          <t>
            This can be done via a DODAG Configuration Option flag which will propogate
            through the network.  Failure to receive this information will cause new
            nodes to remain in compatibility mode, and originate traffic with
            the old-RPI (0x63) value.
          </t>
          <t>
            As stated in <xref target="RFC6550"/> the DODAG Configuration option is present in DIO messages.
            The DODAG Configuration option distributes configuration
            information.  It is generally static, and does not change within
            the DODAG.
            This information is configured at the DODAG root and distributed
            throughout the DODAG with the DODAG Configuration option.
            Nodes other than the DODAG root do not modify this information when
            propagating the DODAG Configuration option.
          </t>
          <t>
            The DODAG Configuration Option has a Flags field which is modified by this document.
            Currently, the DODAG Configuration Option in <xref target="RFC6550"/> is as follows. .
          </t>
          <t>
              Flags: The 4-bits remaining unused in the Flags field are reserved
              for flags. The field MUST be initialized to zero by the sender
              and MUST be ignored by the receiver.

                A RPL network in general is composed of a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router),
                Backbone Router (6BBR), 6LR (6LoWPAN Router) and 6LN (6LoWPAN
                Node) as leaf logically organized in a DODAG structure.

                RPL defines the RPL Control messages (control plane), a new
                ICMPv6 <xref target="RFC4443"/>  message with Type 155.
                DIS (DODAG Information Solicitation), DIO (DODAG Information Object)
                and DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) messages are
                all RPL Control messages but with different Code values.

                RPL supports two modes of Downward traffic: in storing mode (RPL-SM),
                it is fully stateful; in non-storing (RPL-NSM), it is fully source
                routed. A RPL Instance is either fully storing or fully
                non-storing, i.e. a RPL Instance with a combination of
                storing and non-storing nodes is not supported with the
                current specifications at the time of writing this document.

          The uses cases describe the communication between RPL-aware-nodes,
          with the root (6LBR),  and with Internet.
          This document also describe the communication between nodes
          acting as leaves that do not understand RPL, but are part of the LLN.
          We name these nodes as not-RPL-aware-leaf.
          (e.g. <xref target="sm-nRal2root" /> Flow from not-RPL-aware-leaf to root)

          We describe also how is the communication inside of the LLN
          when it has the final destination addressed outside of the LLN e.g. with
          destination to Internet.

            This document is consistent with the rule that a Header cannot be
            inserted or removed on the fly inside an IPv6 packet that is
            being routed.
            This is a fundamental precept of the IPv6 architecture as
            outlined in <xref target="RFC8200" />.  Extensions may not
            be added or removed except by the sender or the receiver.
          </t>
          <t>
            However, unlike <xref target="RFC6553" />, the Hop-by-Hop Option
            Header used for the RPI artifact has the first two bits set to
            '00'.
            This means that the RPI artifact will be ignored when received by a host
            or router that does not understand that option
            ( Section 4.2 <xref target="RFC8200" />).
          </t>
          <t>
            This means that when the no-drop RPI option code 0x23 is used, a
            packet that leaves the RPL domain of an LLN (or that leaves the LLN
            entirely) will not be discarded when it contains the [RFC6553] RPL
            Hop-by-Hop option known as RPI. Thus, the RPI Hop-by-Hop option MAY
            be left in place even if the end host does not understand it.
          </t>
          <t>
            NOTE: There is some possible security risk when the RPI
            information is released to the Internet.  At this point this is
            a theoretical situation; no clear attack has been described.
            At worst, it is clear that the RPI option would  waste some
            network bandwidth when it escapes.  This is traded off against
            the savings in the LLN by not having to encapsulate the packet in
            order to remove the artifact.
          </t>
          <t>
            Despite being legal to leave the RPI artifact in place,
            an intermediate router that needs to add an extension header
            (SHR3 or RPI Option) MUST still encapsulate the packet in an
            (additional) outer IP header. The new header is placed after
            this new outer IP header.
         </t>
         <t>
           A corollory is that an SHR3 or RPI Option can only be removed by an
            intermediate router if it is placed in an encapsulating IPv6
            Header, which is addressed TO the intermediate router.
            When it does so, the whole encapsulating header must be
            removed. (A replacement may be added).  This sometimes can
            result in outer IP headers being addressed to the next hop
            router using link-local addresses.
          </t>
          <t>
            Both RPI and RH3 headers may be modified in very specific ways
            by routers on the path of the packet without the need to add to
            remove an encapsulating header.  Both headers were designed with
            this modification in
            mind, and both the RPL RH and the RPL option are marked mutable
            but recoverable: so an IPsec AH security header can be applied
            across these headers, but it can not secure the values which mutate.
         </t>
          <t>
            RPI should be present in every single RPL data packet. There is one
            exception in non-storing mode: when a packet is going down from the
            root.  In a downward non-storing mode, the entire route is
            written, so there can be no loops by construction, nor any
            confusion about which forwarding table to use (as the root has
            already made all routing decisions).  However, there are still
            cases, such as in 6tisch, where the instanceID portion of the RPI
            header may still be needed to pick an appropriate priority or
            channel at each hop.
          </t>

          <t>
            In the tables present in this document, the term "RPL aware leaf"
            is has been shortened to
            "Raf", and "not-RPL aware leaf" has been shortened to "~Raf" to
            make the table fit in available space.
          </t>

          <t>
            The earlier examples are more extensive to make sure that the
            process is clear, while later examples are more concise.

        <section title="Storing mode">

          <t>
	         In storing mode (fully stateful), the sender can determine if
           the destination is inside the LLN by
            looking if the destination address is matched by the DIO's PIO option.
          </t>

          <t>
            The following table itemizes which headers are needed in the following
            scenarios, and indicates if the IP-in-IP header must be
            inserted on a hop-by-hop basis, or when it can target the
            destination node directly.  There are these possible situations:
            hop-by-hop necessary (indicated by "hop"), or destination address
            possible (indicated by "dst").  In all cases hop by hop MAY be
            used.
          </t>
          <t>
            In cases where no IP-in-IP header is needed, the column is left
            blank.
          </t>
          <t>
            In all cases the RPI headers are needed, since it identifies
            inconsistencies (loops) in the routing topology.
            In all cases the RH3 is not needed because we do not
            indicate the route in storing mode.
          </t>

          <t>
            In each case, 6LR_i are the intermediate routers from source to destination.
            "1 &lt;= i &gt;= n", n is the number of routers (6LR)
            that the packet go through from source (6LN) to destination.

               <section title="SM: Example of Flow from RPL-aware-leaf to root">

			                 <t>
                        In storing mode, RFC 6553 (RPI) is used
                        to send RPL Information instanceID and rank
                        information.
                        </t>
			                  <t>
                         As stated in Section 16.2 of <xref
                         target="RFC6550"/>  an RPL-aware-leaf node does not
                         generally issue DIO messages; a leaf node accepts
                         DIO messages from upstream.
                        (When the inconsistency in routing occurs, a leaf
                        node will generate a DIO with an infinite rank, to
                        fix it).  It may issue DAO and DIS
                        messages though it generally ignores DAO and DIS
                        messages.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                           In this case the flow comprises:
                        </t>
                        <t>
                        RPL-aware-leaf (6LN) --> 6LR_i --> root(6LBR)
                        </t>
                        <t>
                        For example, a communication flow could be: Node F --> Node E --> Node B --> Node A root(6LBR)
                        </t>
                        <t>
                        As it was mentioned in this document 6LRs, 6LBR are always
                        full-fledged RPL routers.
                        </t>
                         <t>
                           The 6LN (Node F) inserts the RPI header, and sends the
                           packet to 6LR (Node E) which decrements the rank in RPI and
                           sends the packet up. When the packet arrives at
                           6LBR (Node A), the RPI is removed and the packet is
                           processed.
                         </t>
                        <t>
                          No IP-in-IP header is required.
                        </t>

                         <t> The RPI header can be removed by the 6LBR
                         because the packet is addressed to the 6LBR.  The
                         6LN must know that it is communicating with the 6LBR
                         to make use of this scenario.
                         The 6LN can know the address of the 6LBR because it
                         knows the address of the root via the DODAGID in the
                         DIO messages.

                                in a IPv6-in-IPv6 header.  The IPv6-in-IPv6
                                header can be addressed to the next hop (Node B), or to
                                the root (Node A).  The root removes the header and processes
                                the packet.

                        RPL information from RFC 6553 MAY go out to
                        Internet as it will be ignored by nodes which have

                 <t>
                   In this case the flow comprises:
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   not-RPL-aware-leaf (IPv6) --> 6LR_1 --> 6LR_i -->root (6LBR) --> Internet
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 For example, a communication flow could be: Node G --> Node E --> Node B --> Node A root(6LBR) --> Internet
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   The 6LR_1 (i=1) node will add an IP-in-IP(RPI) header addressed either
                   to the root, or hop-by-hop such that the root can remove
                   the RPI header before passing upwards. The IP-in-IP addressed to the root cause less processing overhead.
                    On the other hand, with hop-by-hop the intermediate routers can check the routing tables for a better
                    routing path, thus it could be more efficient and faster. Implementation should decide wich approach to take.
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   The originating node will ideally leave the IPv6 flow
                   label as zero so that the packet can be better compressed through
                   the LLN. The 6LBR will set the flow label of the packet to a
                   non-zero value when sending to the Internet.

                 <t>
                   In <xref target="RFC6550"/> RPL allows a simple one-hop
                   optimization for both storing and non-storing
                   networks.
                   A node may send a packet destined to a one-hop
                   neighbor directly to that node. See section 9 in <xref
                   target="RFC6550"/>.
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   When the nodes are not directly connected, then in storing
                   mode, the flow comprises:
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LN --> 6LR_ia --> common parent (6LR_x) --> 6LR_id -->  6LN
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 For example, a communication flow could be: Node F --> Node D --> Node B --> Node E --> Node H
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LR_ia (Node D) are the intermediate routers from source to the common parent (6LR_x) (Node B)
                   In this case, "1 &lt;= ia &gt;= n", n is the number of routers (6LR)
                   that the packet go through from 6LN (Node F) to the common parent (6LR_x).
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LR_id (Node E) are the intermediate routers from the common parent (6LR_x) (Node B) to destination 6LN (Node H).
                   In this case, "1 &lt;= id &gt;= m", m is the number of routers (6LR)
                   that the packet go through from the common parent (6LR_x)  to destination 6LN.
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   It is assume that the two nodes are in the same RPL Domain
                   (that they share the same DODAG root). At the
                   common parent (Node B), the direction of RPI is changed (from
                   increasing to decreasing the rank).
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   While the 6LR nodes will update the RPI, no node needs to
                   add or remove the RPI, so no IP-in-IP headers are
                   necessary.
                   This may be done regardless of where the destination is,
                   as the included RPI will be ignored by the receiver.

         <t>
          In Non Storing Mode (Non SM) (fully source routed),
          the 6LBR (DODAG root) has complete knowledge about the
          connectivity of all DODAG nodes, and all traffic flows
          through the root node. Thus, there is no need for all nodes to
          know about the existence of non-RPL aware nodes.
          Only the 6LBR needs to act if compensation is necessary for non-RPL
          aware receivers.
         </t>
         <t>
           The following table summarizes what headers are needed in the following
           scenarios, and indicates when the RPI, RH3 and IP-in-IP header must be
           inserted.  There are these possible situations:
          destination address possible (indicated by "dst"), to a 6LR, to a 6LN or to the root.
          In cases where no IP-in-IP header is needed, the column is left blank.
         </t>
         <t>
           The leaf can be a router 6LR or a host, both indicated as 6LN (Figure 3).

                        In non-storing mode the leaf node uses default
                        routing to send traffic to the root. The RPI header
                        must be included to avoid/detect loops.

                        <t>
                          6LR_i are the intermediate routers from source to destination.
                          In this case, "1 &lt;= i &gt;= n", n is the number of routers (6LR)
                          that the packet go through from source (6LN) to destination (6LBR).

                        <t>
                          In 6LBR the RH3 is added, it is modified at each
                          intermediate 6LR (6LR_1 and so on) and
                          it is fully consumed in the last 6LR (6LR_n), but left there.
                          If RPI is left present, the IPv6 node which
                          does not understand it will ignore it (following
                          RFC8200),
                          thus encapsulation is not necesary.
                          Due the complete knowledge of the topology at the
                          root,
                          the 6LBR may optionally address the IP-in-IP header
                          to the last 6LR, such that it is removed prior to
                          the IPv6 node.

                          that the packet go through from 6LBR to destination(6LN).

                          The 6LBR must add an RH3 header.  As the 6LBR will
                          know the path and address of the target node, it can
                          address the IP-in-IP header to that node.
                          The 6LBR will zero the flow label upon entry in
                          order to aid compression.

                          such as 6tisch.  The RPI is unnecessary for loop detection.

                          This case involves only nodes in same RPL Domain.
                          The originating node will add an RPI header to the
                          original packet, and send the packet upwards.

                        <t>
                          The originating node SHOULD put the RPI into an IP-in-IP
                          header addressed to the root, so that the 6LBR can
                          remove that header.  If it does not, then
                          additional resources are wasted on the way down to
                          carry the useless RPI option.

                          The 6LBR will need to insert an RH3 header, which
                          requires that it add an IP-in-IP header.  It SHOULD be
                          able to remove the RPI, as it was contained in an
                          IP-in-IP header addressed to it.  Otherwise, there MAY
                          be an RPI header buried inside the inner IP header,
                          which should get ignored.

         <section title="Storing mode">
<!--          <t>
            Without the modifications in 2460 bis, we would have in the completely general storing case, which includes not-RPL
            aware leaf nodes, it is not possible for a sending node to know
            if the destination is RPL aware, and therefore it must always use
            hop-by-hop IP-in-IP encapsulation, and it can never omit the IP-in-IP
            encapsulation.  See table <xref target="table_storing" />
          </t>
-->
          <t>
           <xref target="RFC8138" /> shows that the
            hop-by-hop IP-in-IP header can be compressed using IP-in-IP 6LoRH (IP-in-IP-6LoRH) header
            as described in Section 7 of the document.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are potential significant advantages to having a single
            code path that always processes IP-in-IP headers with no options.
          </t>
          <t>
            Thanks to the change of the RPI option type from 0x63 to 0x23, there
            is no longer any uncertainty about when to use an IP-in-IP header in the
            storing mode. A Hop-by-Hop Options Header containing the RPI option
            SHOULD always be added when 6LRs originate packets (without IP-in-IP
            headers), and IP-in-IP headers should always be added (addressed to the
            root when on the way up, to the end-host when on the way down) when
            a 6LR find that it needs to insert a Hop-by-Hop Options Header
            containing the RPI option.

          </t>
         </section>

        <section title="Non-Storing mode">
          <t>
            In the non-storing case, dealing with non-RPL aware leaf nodes
            is much easier as the 6LBR (DODAG root) has complete knowledge
            about the connectivity of all DODAG nodes, and all traffic flows
            through the root node.
          </t>
          <t>
            The 6LBR can recognize non-RPL aware leaf nodes because it will
            receive a DAO about that node from the 6LN immediately above that
            node.  This means that the non-storing mode case can avoid ever
            using hop-by-hop IP-in-IP headers for traffic originating from
            the root to leafs.
          </t>
          <t>
            The non-storing mode case does not require the type change from
            0x63 to 0x23, as the root can always create the right packet.
            The type change does not adversely affect the non-storing case.

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
           <t>
             The security considerations covering of <xref target="RFC6553"/> and
             <xref target="RFC6554"/> apply when the packets get into RPL
             Domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            The IPIP mechanism described in this document is much more
            limited than the general mechanism described in <xref
            target="RFC2473"/>.  The willingness of each node in the LLN to
            decapsulate packets and forward them could be exploited by nodes to
            disguise the origin of an attack.
          </t>
          <t>
            Nodes outside of the LLN will need to pass IPIP traffic through
            the RPL root to perform this attack. To counter, the RPL
            root SHOULD either restrict ingress of IPIP packets (the simpler
            solution), or it SHOULD do a deep packet inspection wherein it
            walks the IP header extension chain until it can inspect the
            upper-layer-payload as described in <xref target="RFC7045" />.
            In particular, the RPL root SHOULD do BCP38 (<xref target="RFC2827" />)
            processing on the source addresses of all IP headers that it
            examines in both directions.
          </t>
          <t>Note: there are some situations where a prefix will spread
          across multiple LLNs via mechanisms such as described in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router" />.
          In this case the BCP38 filtering needs to take this into account.
          </t>
          <t>
            Nodes with the LLN can use the IPIP mechanism to mount an
            attack on another part of the LLN, while disguising the origin of
            the attack.  The mechanism can even be abused to make it appear
            that the attack is coming from outside the LLN, and unless
            countered, this could be used to mount a Distributed Denial Of
            Service attack upon nodes elsewhere in the Internet. See <xref
            target="DDOS-KREBS" /> for an example of such attacks already
            seen in the real world.
          </t>
          <t>
            While a typical LLN may be a very poor origin for attack traffic
            (as the networks tend to be very slow,
            and the nodes often have very low duty cycles) given enough
            nodes,
            they could still have a
            significant impact, particularly if the attack was on another LLN!
            Additionally, some uses of RPL involve large backbone ISP scale
            equipment <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>,
            which may be equipped with multiple 100Gb/s interfaces.
          </t>
          <t>
            Blocking or careful filtering of IPIP traffic entering the LLN as
            described above will make sure that any attack that is mounted
            must originate compromised nodes within the LLN.
            The use of BCP38 filtering at the RPL root on egress traffic will
            both alert the operator to the existence of the attack, as well
            as drop the attack traffic.  As the RPL network is typically
            numbered from a single prefix, which is itself assigned by RPL,
            BCP38 filtering involves a single prefix comparison and should be
            trivial to automatically configure.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are some scenarios where IPIP traffic SHOULD be allowed to
            pass through the RPL root, such as the IPIP mediated
            communications between a new Pledge and the Join
            Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) when
            using <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra" /> and
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join" />. This is
            the case for the RPL root to do careful filtering: it occurs only
            when the Join Coordinator is not co-located inside the RPL root.
          </t>

          <t>
            With the above precautions, an attack using IPIP tunnels will be
            by a node within the LLN on another node within the LLN.  Such an
            attack could, of course, be done directly.  An attack of this
            kind is meaningful only if the source addresses are either fake
            or if the point is to amplify return traffic.
            Such an attack, could also be done without the use of IPIP
            headers using forged source addresses.
            If the attack requires bi-directional communication, then IPIP
            provides no advantages.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="RFC2473"/> suggests that tunnel entry and exit
            points can be secured, via the "Use IPsec". This solution has
            all the problems that <xref target="RFC5406" /> goes into.
            In an LLN such a solution would degenerate into every node having
            a tunnel with every other node.  It would provide a small amount
            of origin address authentication at a very high cost; doing BCP38
            at every node (linking layer-3 addresses to layer-2 addresses,
            and to already present layer-2 cryptographic mechanisms) would be
            cheaper should RPL be run in an environment where hostile nodes
            are likely to be a part of the LLN.
          </t>
          <t>
            The RH3 header usage described here can be abused in equivalent
            ways with an IPIP header to add the needed RH3
            header. As such, the attacker's RH3 header will not be seen by
            the network until it reaches the end host, which will decapsulate
            it.  An end-host SHOULD be suspicious about a RH3 header which
            has additional hops which have not yet been processed, and SHOULD
            ignore such a second RH3 header.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition, the LLN will likely use <xref
            target="RFC8138" /> to compress the IPIP
            and RH3 headers. As such, the compressor at the RPL-root will see
            the second RH3 header and MAY choose to discard the packet if the
            RH3 header has not been completely consumed.  A consumed (inert)
            RH3 header could be present in a packet that flows from one LLN,
            crosses the Internet, and enters another LLN.  As per the
            discussion in this document, such headers do not need to be
            removed.  However, there is no case described in this document
            where an RH3 is inserted in a non-storing network on traffic that
            is leaving the LLN, but this document SHOULD NOT preclude such a
            future innovation.  It should just be noted that an incoming RH3
            must be fully consumed, or very carefully inspected.
          </t>
          <t>
            The RPI header, if permitted to enter the LLN, could be used by
            an attacker to change the priority of a packet by selecting a
            different RPL instanceID, perhaps one with a higher energy cost,
            for instance.  It could also be that not all nodes are reachable
            in an LLN using the default instanceID, but a change of
            instanceID would permit an attacker to bypass such filtering.
            Like the RH3, an RPI header is to be inserted by the RPL root on
            traffic entering the LLN by first inserting an IPIP header. The
            attacker's RPI header therefore will not be seen by the network.
            Upon reaching the destination node the RPI header has no further
            meaning and is just skipped; the presence of a second RPI header
            will have no meaning to the end node as the packet has already
            been identified as being at it's final destination.
          </t>
          <t>
            The RH3 and RPI headers could be abused by an attacker inside of
            the network to route packets on non-obvious ways, perhaps eluding
            observation.   This usage is in fact part of
            <xref target="RFC6997" /> and can not be restricted at all. This
            is a feature, not a bug.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="RFC7416"/> deals with many other threats to LLNs
            not directly related to the use of IPIP headers, and this
            document does not change that analysis.
          </t>
