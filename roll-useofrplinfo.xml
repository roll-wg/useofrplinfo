      <t>
        This document looks at different data flows through LLN (Low-Power and Lossy Networks) where RPL
        (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) is used to establish routing.
        The document enumerates the cases where RFC6553 (RPL Option Type), RFC6554 (Routing Header for Source Routes)
        and IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation is required in data plane.
        This analysis provides the basis on which to design efficient compression of these headers.
        This document updates RFC6553 adding a change to the RPL Option Type. Additionally, this document updates
        RFC6550 defining a flag in the DIO Configuration Option to indicate about this change and
        updates RFC8138 as well to consider the new Option Type when the RPL Option is decompressed.

          <section title="Introduction">
             <t>
               RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks)
               <xref target="RFC6550"/> is a routing protocol for
                constrained networks. RFC6553 <xref target="RFC6553"/>
                defines the "RPL option" (RPL Packet Information or RPI), carried within the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
                header to quickly identify inconsistencies (loops) in the routing topology.
                RFC6554 <xref target="RFC6554"/> defines the "RPL Source Route Header" (RH3), an
                IPv6 Extension Header to deliver datagrams within a RPL
                routing domain, particularly in non-storing mode.
             </t>
             <t>
                These various items are referred to as RPL artifacts, and
                they are seen on all of the data-plane traffic that occurs in
                RPL routed networks; they do not in general appear on the RPL
                control plane traffic at all which is mostly hop-by-hop
                traffic (one exception being DAO messages in non-storing mode).
             </t>
             <t>
               It has become clear from attempts to do multi-vendor
               interoperability, and from a desire to compress as many of
               the above artifacts as possible that not all implementers
               agree when artifacts are necessary, or when they can be safely
               omitted, or removed.
             </t>

             <t>
               The ROLL WG analysized how <xref target="RFC2460" /> rules apply to storing and
               non-storing use of RPL.  The result was 24 data plane use
               cases.  They are exhaustively outlined here in order to be
               completely unambiguous.  During the processing of this
               document, new rules were published as
               <xref target="RFC8200"/>, and this document was updated
               to reflect the normative changes in that document.
             </t>
             <t>
               This document updates RFC6553, changing the RPI option value
               to make RFC8200 routers ignore this option by default.
             </t>
             <t>
               A Routing Header Dispatch for 6LoWPAN (6LoRH)(<xref target="RFC8138" />)
                defines a mechanism for compressing RPL Option information and Routing Header type 3 (RH3)
                <xref target="RFC6554"/>, as well as an efficient IPv6-in-IPv6 technique.
             </t><t>
                Since some of the uses cases here described, use IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation. It
                MUST take in consideration, when encapsulation is applied, the RFC6040 <xref target="RFC6040"/>, which
                defines how the explicit congestion notification (ECN) field of the IP header should
                be constructed on entry to and exit from any IPV6-in-IPV6 tunnel. Additionally, it is recommended
                the reading of <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels"/> that explains the relationship of IP
                tunnels to existing protocol layers and the challenges in supporting IP tunneling.

              <t>
                Non-constrained uses of RPL are not in scope of this document, and
                applicability statements for those uses may provide different
                advice, E.g. <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane" />.

          Hop-by-hop re-encapsulation: The term "hop-by-hop re-encapsulation" header refers to adding a header
          that originates from a node to an adjacent node, using the
          addresses (usually the GUA or ULA, but could use the link-local addresses)
          of each node.  If the packet must traverse multiple hops, then it
          must be decapsulated at each hop, and then re-encapsulated again
          in a similar fashion.

         <t>
       Non-storing Mode (Non-SM): RPL mode of operation in which the RPL-aware-nodes send information to the root
       about its parents. Thus, the root know the topology, then the intermediate 6LRs do not maintain
       routing state so that source routing is needed.

       <t>
        Storing Mode (SM): RPL mode of operation in which RPL-aware-nodes (6LRs) maintain routing
        state (of the children) so that source routing is not needed.

        RPL supports two modes of Downward traffic: in storing mode (SM),
        it is fully stateful; in non-storing mode (Non-SM), it is fully source
        routed. A RPL Instance is either fully storing or fully
        non-storing, i.e. a RPL Instance with a combination of
        storing and non-storing nodes is not supported with the
        current specifications at the time of writing this document.

          <t>
          This document illustrates that is is not always possible to know for sure at the source that a packet will only travel within the RPL domain or may leave it.

          </t><t>
          At the time <xref target="RFC6553"/> was published, leaking a Hop-by-Hop header in the outer IPv6 header chain could potentially impact core routers in the internet. So at that time, it was decided to encapsulate any packet with a RPL option using IPv6-in-IPv6 in all cases where it was unclear whether the packet would remain within the RPL domain. In the exception case where a packet would still leak, the Option Type would ensure that the first router in the Internet that does not recognize the option would drop the packet and protect the rest of the network.

          </t><t>
          Even with <xref target="RFC8138"/> that compresses the IPv6-in-IPv6 header, this approach yields extra bytes in a packet which means consuming more energy, more bandwidth, incurring higher chances of loss and possibly causing a fragmentation at the 6LoWPAN level. This impacts the daily operation of constrained devices for a case that generally does not happen and would not heavily impact the core anyway.
          </t><t>

          While intention was and remains that the Hop-by-Hop header with a RPL option should be confined within the RPL domain, this specification modifies this behavior in order to reduce the dependency on IPv6-in-IPv6 and protect the constrained devices. Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8200"/> clarifies the behaviour of routers in the Internet as follows: "it is now expected that nodes along a packet's delivery path only examine and process the Hop-by-Hop Options header if explicitly configured to do so".
          </t><t>
          When unclear about the travel of a packet, it becomes preferable for a source not to encapsulate, accepting the fact that the packet may leave the RPL domain on its way to its destination. In that event, the packet should reach its destination and should not be discarded by the first node that does not recognize the RPL option. But with the current value of the Option Type, if a node in the Internet is configured to process the Hop-by-Hop header, and if such node encounters an option with the first two bits set to 01 and conforms to <xref target="RFC8200"/>, it will drop the packet. Host systems should do the same, irrespective of the configuration.
          </t>
          <t>
           Thus, this document updates the Option Type field to (<xref target="fig_RPIOption_new"/>):
           the two high order bits MUST be set to '00'
           and the third bit is equal to '1'.
           The first two bits indicate that the IPv6 node MUST
           skip over this option and continue processing the header
           (<xref target="RFC8200"/> Section 4.2)
           if it doesn't recognize the option type,
           and the third bit continues to be set to indicate that the Option
           Data may change en route. The remaining bits serve as the option type and remain as 0x3.
           This ensures that a packet that leaves the RPL domain of an LLN (or that
           leaves the LLN entirely) will not be discarded when it contains the
           [RFC6553] RPL Hop-by-Hop option known as RPI.
          </t>
          <t>
          With the new Option Type, if an IPv6 (intermediate) node (RPL-not-capable) receives a packet with an
          RPL Option, it should ignore the Hop-by-Hop RPL option
          (skip over this option and continue processing the header). This is relevant, as it was mentioned previously, in the case that
          there is a flow from RAL to Internet (see <xref target="sm-Ral2i" />).
          </t>
          <t>
           This is a significant update to <xref target="RFC6553"/>.

            Without the signaling described below, this change would otherwise create a lack of interoperation (flag day) for existing networks which are
            currently using 0x63 as the RPI value.  A move to 0x23 will not
            be understood by those networks.  It is suggested that
            RPL implementations accept both 0x63 and 0x23 when
            processing the header.
          </t>
          <t>
            When forwarding packets, implementations SHOULD use
            the same value as it was received (This is required because,
            RPI type code can not be changed by <xref target="RFC8200"/> - Section 4.2).
            It allows to the network to be incrementally upgraded,
            and for the DODAG root to know which parts of the network are upgraded.
          </t>
          <t>
            When originating new packets,
            implementations SHOULD have an option to determine which value to
            originate with, this option is controlled by the DIO option
            described below.
          </t>
          <t>
          A network which is switching from straight 6LoWPAN compression
          mechanism to those described in
          <xref target="RFC8138" />
          will experience a flag day in the data compression anyway, and if
          possible this change can be deployed at the same time.
        </t>
        <t>
          The change of RPI option type from 0x63 to 0x23, makes all
          <xref target="RFC8200"/> Section 4.2 compliant nodes tolerant of the RPL artifacts.  There
          is therefore no longer a necessity to remove the artifacts when
          sending traffic to the Internet.  This change clarifies when
          to use an IPv6-in-IPv6 header, and how to address them:
          The Hop-by-Hop Options Header containing the RPI option MUST always
          be added when 6LRs originate packets (without IPv6-in-IPv6
          headers), and IPv6-in-IPv6 headers MUST always be added
          when a 6LR find that it needs to insert a Hop-by-Hop Options Header
          containing the RPI option. The IPv6-in-IPv6 header is to
          be addressed to the
          RPL root when on the way up, and to the end-host when on the way down.
        </t>

        <t>
          In the non-storing case, dealing with not-RPL aware leaf nodes
          is much easier as the 6LBR (DODAG root) has complete knowledge
          about the connectivity of all DODAG nodes, and all traffic flows
          through the root node.
        </t>
        <t>
          The 6LBR can recognize not-RPL aware leaf nodes because it will
          receive a DAO about that node from the 6LR immediately above that
          not-RPL aware node.  This means that the non-storing mode case can avoid ever
          using hop-by-hop re-encapsulation headers for traffic originating from
          the root to the leafs.
        </t>
        <t>
          The non-storing mode case does not require the type change from
          0x63 to 0x23, as the root can always create the right packet.
          The type change does not adversely affect the non-storing case.
        </t>

<!--        <t>
          In general, any packet that leaves the RPL domain
          of an LLN (or leaves the LLN entirely) will NOT be discarded, when it has the <xref target="RFC6553" /> RPL Option
          Header known as the RPI or <xref target="RFC6554" /> SRH3 Extension Header (S)RH3.
          Because of <xref target="RFC8200"/> the RPI Hop-by-Hop option
          MAY be left in place even if the end host does not
          understand it.

                        DODAG Configuration Option Flag. " anchor="update6550">
        <t>
          In order to avoid a Flag Day caused by lack of interoperation
          between new RPI (0x23) and old RPI (0x63) nodes, this section
          defines a flag in the DIO Configuration Option, to indicate when
          then new RPI value can be safely used. This means, the flag is going
          to indicate the type of RPI that the network is using. Thus, when a
          node join to a network will know which value to use.
          With this, RPL-capable nodes know if it is safe to use 0x23 when creating a new RPI.
          A node that forwards a packet with an RPI MUST NOT modify the option type of the RPI.
        </t>
          <t>
            This is  done via a DODAG Configuration Option flag which will
	          propagate through the network.  If the flag is received with a
	          value zero (which is the default), then new nodes will remain in
            RFC6553 Compatible Mode; originating traffic with the old-RPI (0x63) value.
          </t>
          <t>
            As stated in <xref target="RFC6550"/> the DODAG Configuration option is present in DIO messages.
            The DODAG Configuration option distributes configuration
            information.  It is generally static, and does not change within
            the DODAG.
            This information is configured at the DODAG root and distributed
            throughout the DODAG with the DODAG Configuration option.
            Nodes other than the DODAG root do not modify this information when
            propagating the DODAG Configuration option.
          </t>
          <t>
            The DODAG Configuration Option has a Flag field which is modified by this document.
            Currently, the DODAG Configuration Option in <xref target="RFC6550"/> states:
            "the unused bits MUST be initialize to zero by the sender
             and MUST be ignored by the receiver".
          </t>
            <t>
           Bit number three of the flag field in the DODAG Configuration option
           is to be used as shown in <xref target="fig_RPIflagday2"/> :

            In case of rebooting, the node (6LN or 6LR) does not remember the RPL Option Type, that is if the flag is
            set, so DIO messages sent by the node would be set with the flag unset until a DIO message
            is received with the flag set indicating the new RPI value. The node sets to 0x23 if the node supports this feature.

          <t>
            RPI-6LoRH header provides a compressed form for the RPL RPI <xref
            target="RFC8138"/> in section 6.  A node that is decompressing this header
            MUST decompress using the RPL RPI option type that is currently active: that
            is, a choice between 0x23 (new) and 0x63 (old).  The node will know which to
            use based upon the presence of the flag in the DODAG Configuration Option defined in
            <xref target="update6550" />. E.g. If the network is in 0x23 mode (by DIO option),
            then it should be decompressed to 0x23.

        <t>

        <t>
          There are potential significant advantages to having a single
          code path that always processes IPv6-in-IPv6 headers with no

            This document is consistent with the rule that a Header cannot be
            inserted or removed on the fly inside an IPv6 packet that is
            being routed.
            This is a fundamental precept of the IPv6 architecture as
            outlined in <xref target="RFC8200" />.
          </t>
<!--
          <t>
            However, unlike <xref target="RFC6553" />, the Hop-by-Hop Option
            Header used for the RPI artifact has the first two bits set to
            '00'.
            This means that the RPI artifact will be ignored when received by a host
            or router that does not understand that option
            ( Section 4.2 <xref target="RFC8200" />).
          </t>
          <t>
            This means that when the no-drop RPI option code 0x23 is used, a
            packet that leaves the RPL domain of an LLN (or that leaves the LLN
            entirely) will not be discarded when it contains the [RFC6553] RPL
            Hop-by-Hop option known as RPI. Thus, the RPI Hop-by-Hop option is
            left in place even if the end host does not understand it.
          </t>
          <t>
            NOTE: No clear attack has been described when the RPI information is released to the Internet.
            At a minimum, it is clear that the RPI option would waste some network bandwidth when it escapes.
            This is traded off against the savings in the LLN by not having to encapsulate the packet
            in order to remove the artifact. Please check the Security Considerations sections
            <xref target="Security"/> for further details.
          </t>
  -->
          <t>
            As the rank information in the RPI artifact is changed at each
            hop, it will typically be zero when it arrives at the DODAG
            root.  The DODAG root MUST force it to zero when passing the
            packet out to the Internet.  The Internet will therefore not see
            any SenderRank information.
          </t>
          <t>
            Despite being legal to leave the RPI artifact in place,
            an intermediate router that needs to add an extension header
            (e.g. RH3 or RPI Option) MUST still encapsulate the packet in an
            (additional) outer IP header. The new header is placed after
            this new outer IP header.
         </t>
         <t>
           A corollary is that an RH3 or RPI Option can only be removed by an
            intermediate router if it is placed in an encapsulating IPv6
            Header, which is addressed TO the intermediate router.
            When it does so, the whole encapsulating header must be
            removed. (A replacement may be added).  This sometimes can
            result in outer IP headers being addressed to the next hop
            router using link-local address.
          </t>
          <t>
            Both RPI and RH3 headers may be modified in very specific ways
            by routers on the path of the packet without the need to add and
            remove an encapsulating header.  Both headers were designed with
            this modification in
            mind, and both the RPL RH3 and the RPL option are marked mutable
            but recoverable: so an IPsec AH security header can be applied
            across these headers, but it can not secure the values which mutate.
          </t>

          <t>
            RPI MUST be present in every single RPL data packet.
          </t>

          <t>
            Prior to <xref target="RFC8138" />, there was significant
            interest in removing the RPI for downward flows in non-storing
            mode.  The exception covered a very small number of cases, and
            causes significant interoperability challenges, yet costed
            significant code and testing complexity.  The ability to compress
            the RPI down to three bytes or less removes much of the pressure
            to optimize this any further <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane" />.

	         In storing mode (SM) (fully stateful), the sender can determine if
           the destination is inside the LLN by
            looking if the destination address is matched by the DIO's Prefix Information Option (PIO) option.
          </t>

          <t>
            The following table (<xref target="fig_EncStoMode"/>) itemizes which headers are needed in each of the following scenarios.
            It indicates if the IPv6-in-IPv6 header that is added, must be addressed to the final destination (the RAL node that is the target(tgt)),
            to the "root" or if a hop-by-hop header must be added (indicated by "hop").  In the hop-by-hop basis, the destination address in each hop is copied from
            the inner packet into the encapsulating packet.

          </t>

          <t>
            In cases where no IPv6-in-IPv6 header is needed, the column states as "No".
            If the IPv6-in-IPv6 header is needed is a "must".

          </t>
          <t>
            In all cases the RPI headers are needed, since it identifies
            inconsistencies (loops) in the routing topology.
            In all cases the RH3 is not needed because it is not used
            in storing mode.

          <t>
            In each case, 6LR_i are the intermediate routers from source to destination.
            "1 &lt;= i &lt;= n", n is the number of routers (6LR)
            that the packet goes through from source (6LN) to destination.

                   The 6LR_1 (i=1) node will add an IPv6-in-IPv6(RPI) header addressed either
                   to the root, or hop-by-hop such that the root can remove
                   the RPI header before passing upwards. The IPv6-in-IPv6 addressed to the root cause less processing overhead.
                    On the other hand, with hop-by-hop the intermediate routers can check the routing tables for a better
                    routing path, thus it could be more efficient and faster. Implementation should decide which approach to take.

                   When the nodes are not directly connected, then in storing
                   mode, the flow comprises:
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LN --> 6LR_ia --> common parent (6LR_x) --> 6LR_id -->  6LN
                 </t>
                 <t>
                 For example, a communication flow could be: Node F --> Node D --> Node B --> Node E --> Node H
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LR_ia (Node D) are the intermediate routers from source to the common parent (6LR_x) (Node B)
                   In this case, 1 &lt;= ia &lt;= n, n is the number of routers (6LR)
                   that the packet goes through from 6LN (Node F) to the common parent (6LR_x).
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   6LR_id (Node E) are the intermediate routers from the common parent (6LR_x) (Node B) to destination 6LN (Node H).
                   In this case, 1 &lt;= id &lt;= m, m is the number of routers (6LR)
                   that the packet goes through from the common parent (6LR_x)  to destination 6LN.
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   It is assumed that the two nodes are in the same RPL Domain
                   (that they share the same DODAG root). At the
                   common parent (Node B), the direction of RPI is changed (from
                   increasing to decreasing the rank).
                 </t>
                 <t>
                   While the 6LR nodes will update the RPI, no node needs to
                   add or remove the RPI, so no IPv6-in-IPv6 headers are
                   necessary.

<!--
                   This may be done regardless of where the destination is,
                   as the included RPI will be ignored by the receiver.

         <t>
          In Non Storing Mode (Non-SM) (fully source routed),
          the 6LBR (DODAG root) has complete knowledge about the
          connectivity of all DODAG nodes, and all traffic flows
          through the root node. Thus, there is no need for all nodes to
          know about the existence of not-RPL aware nodes.
          Only the 6LBR needs to act if compensation is necessary for not-RPL
          aware receivers.
         </t>
         <t>
           The following table (<xref target="fig_table_non-storing" />) summarizes what headers are needed in the following
           scenarios, and indicates when the RPI, RH3 and IPv6-in-IPv6 header
           are to be inserted.  It depicts the
           target destination address possible (indicated by "RAL"), to a 6LR (parent of a 6LN) or to the root.
           In cases where no IPv6-in-IPv6 header is needed, the column states as "No".
           There is no expectation on RPL that RPI can be omitted, because it is needed for routing, quality of service and compression.
           This specification expects that is always a RPI Present.
         </t>
         <t>
           The leaf can be a router 6LR or a host, both indicated as 6LN (Figure 3). In the Figure the
           (1) indicates a 6tisch case <xref target="RFC8180"/>, where the RPI header may still be needed
          for the instanceID to be available for priority/channel selection at each hop.

                          address the IPv6-in-IPv6 header to that node.
                          The 6LBR will zero the flow label upon entry in

                          RUL (IPv6) --> 6LR_1 --> 6LR_i -->root (6LBR) --> Internet

                        <t>
                        For example, a communication flow could be: Node G --> Node E --> Node B --> Node A --> Internet

                        <t>
                          6LR_i are the intermediate routers from source to destination.
                          In this case, "1 &lt; i &lt;= n", n is the number of routers (6LR)
                          that the packet goes through from source(IPv6) to 6LBR. e.g 6LR_1 (i=1).

                                be zero in the IPv6 node. As RPL headers are
                                added in the IPv6 node packet, the first 6LR (6LR_1) will
                                add a RPI header inside a new IPv6-in-IPv6 header.
                                The IPv6-in-IPv6 header will be addressed to the
                                root.  This case is identical to the
                                storing-mode case (see <xref target="sm-nRal2i" />).

                          The 6LBR will know the path, and will recognize

                          The 6LBR will set to zero the flow label upon entry in

                          The 6LBR will then insert an RH3 inside a new IPv6-in-IPv6

          <section title="Operational Considerations of supporting
                          not-RPL-aware-leaves" anchor="notrplaware">
            <t>
              Roughly half of the situations described in this document
              involve leaf ("host") nodes that do not speak RPL.  These nodes
              fall into two further categories: ones that drop a packet
              that have RPI or RH3 headers, and ones that continue to
              process a packet that has RPI and/or RH3 headers.
            </t>
            <t>
              <xref target="RFC8200" /> provides for new rules that suggest
              that nodes that have not been configured (explicitly) to
              examine Hop-by-Hop headers, should ignore those headers, and
              continue processing the packet.  Despite this, and despite the
              switch from 0x63 to 0x23, there may be hosts that are pre-RFC8200,
              or simply intolerant.  Those hosts will drop packets that
              continue to have RPL artifacts in them.  In general, such
              hosts can not be easily supported in RPL LLNs.
            </t>
            <t>
              There are some specific cases where it is possible to remove
              the RPL artifacts prior to forwarding the packet to the leaf
              host.  The critical thing is that the artifacts have been
              inserted by the RPL root inside an IPv6-in-IPv6 header, and
              that the header has been addressed to the 6LR immediately prior
              to the leaf node. In that case, in the process of removing the
              IPv6-in-IPv6 header, the artifacts can also be removed.
            </t>
            <t>
              The above case occurs whenever traffic originates from the
              outside the LLN (the "Internet" cases above), and non-storing
              mode is used.  In non-storing mode, the RPL root knows the
              exact topology (as it must be create the RH3 header), and
              therefore knows what the 6LR prior to the leaf. For example,
              in Figure 5, node E is the 6LR prior to the leaf node G, or
              node C is the 6LR prior to the leaf node J.
            </t>
            <t>
              traffic originating from the RPL root (such as when the data
              collection system is co-located on the RPL root), does not
              require an IPv6-in-IPv6 header (in either mode), as the packet
              is originating at the root, and the root can insert the RPI
              and RH3 headers directly into the packet, as it is formed.
              Such a packet is slightly smaller, but only can be sent to
              nodes (whether RPL aware or not), that will tolerate the
              RPL artifacts.
            </t>
            <t>
              An operator that finds itself with a lot of traffic from the
              RPL root to RPL-not-aware-leaves, will have to do IPv6-in-IPv6
              encapsulation if the leaf is not tolerant of the RPL artifacts.
              Such an operator could otherwise omit this unnecessary header
              if it was certain of the properties of the leaf.
            </t>
            <t>
              As storing mode can not know the final path of the traffic,
              intolerant (that drop packets with RPL artifacts) leaf nodes
              can not be supported.
            </t>

       <section title="Operational considerations of introducing 0x23">
         <t>
           This section describes the operational considerations of introducing the new RPI value of 0x23.
         </t>

           <t>
             During bootstrapping the node gets the DIO with the information of RPL Option Type, indicating
             the new RPI in the DODAG Configuration Option Flag.
             The DODAG root is in charge to configure the current network to the new value, through DIO
             messages and when all the nodes are set with the new value. The DODAG should change to a new DODAG version.
             In case of rebooting, the node does not remember the RPL Option Type.
             Thus, the DIO is sent with a flag indicating the new RPI value.
           </t>
           <t>
           The DODAG Configuration option is contained in a RPL DIO message, which contains a unique DTSN counter.
           The leaf nodes respond to this message with DAO messages containing the same DTSN.
           This is a normal part of RPL routing; the RPL root therefore knows when the updated
           DODAG Configuration Option has been seen by all nodes.
           </t>
           <t>
             Before the migration happens, all the RPL-aware nodes should support both values .
             The migration procedure it is triggered when the DIO is sent with the flag
             indicating the new RPI value.
             Namely, it remains at 0x63 until it is sure that the network is capable of 0x23, then it abruptly change to 0x23.
             This options allows to send packets to not-RPL nodes, which should ignore the option and continue processing the packets.

           </t>
           <t>
             In case that a node join to a network that only process 0x63, it would produce a flag day as was mentioned previously.
             Indicating the new RPI in the DODAG Configuration Option Flag is a way to avoid the flag day in a network.
             It is recommended that a network process both options to enable interoperability.

        <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
           <t>
             The security considerations covered in <xref target="RFC6553"/> and
             <xref target="RFC6554"/> apply when the packets are in the RPL
             Domain.
          </t>
          <t>
            The IPv6-in-IPv6 mechanism described in this document is much more
            limited than the general mechanism described in <xref
            target="RFC2473"/>.  The willingness of each node in the LLN to
            decapsulate packets and forward them could be exploited by nodes to
            disguise the origin of an attack.
          </t>

          <t>
            While a typical LLN may be a very poor origin for attack traffic
            (as the networks tend to be very slow,
            and the nodes often have very low duty cycles) given enough
            nodes, they could still have a
            significant impact, particularly if attack is targeting another LLN.
            Additionally, some uses of RPL involve large backbone ISP scale
            equipment <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane"/>,
            which may be equipped with multiple 100Gb/s interfaces.
          </t>
          <t>
            Blocking or careful filtering of IPv6-in-IPv6 traffic entering the LLN as
            described above will make sure that any attack that is mounted
            must originate from compromised nodes within the LLN.
            The use of BCP38 <xref target="BCP38"/> filtering at the RPL root on egress traffic will
            both alert the operator to the existence of the attack, as well
            as drop the attack traffic.  As the RPL network is typically
            numbered from a single prefix, which is itself assigned by RPL,
            BCP38 filtering involves a single prefix comparison and should be
            trivial to automatically configure.
          </t>
          <t>
            There are some scenarios where IPv6-in-IPv6 traffic should be allowed to
            pass through the RPL root, such as the IPv6-in-IPv6 mediated
            communications between a new Pledge and the Join
            Registrar/Coordinator (JRC) when
            using <xref target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra" /> and
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-dtsecurity-secure-join" />. This is
            the case for the RPL root to do careful filtering: it occurs only
            when the Join Coordinator is not co-located inside the RPL root.
          </t>

          <t>
            With the above precautions, an attack using IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels can only be
            by a node within the LLN on another node within the LLN.  Such an
            attack could, of course, be done directly.  An attack of this
            kind is meaningful only if the source addresses are either fake
            or if the point is to amplify return traffic.
            Such an attack, could also be done without the use of IPv6-in-IPv6
            headers using forged source addresses.
            If the attack requires bi-directional communication, then IPv6-in-IPv6
            provides no advantages.
          </t>

          <t>
            Whenever IPv6-in-IPv6 headers are being proposed, there is a concern
            about creating security issues.  In the security section of
            <xref target="RFC2473"/>, it was suggested that tunnel entry and exit
            points can be secured, via "Use IPsec".  This recommendation is
            not practical for RPL networks.  <xref target="RFC5406" /> goes
            into some detail on what additional details would be needed in
            order to "Use IPsec". Use of ESP would prevent RFC8183
            compression (compression must occur before encryption), and
            RFC8183 compression is lossy in a way that prevents use of AH.
            These are minor issues.  The major issue is how to establish
            trust enough such that IKEv2 could be used.  This would require a
            system of certificates to be present in every single node,
            including any Internet nodes that might need to communicate with
            the LLN.  Thus, "Use IPsec" requires a global PKI in the general
            case.
          </t>
          <t>
            More significantly, the use of IPsec tunnels to protect the IPv6-in-IPv6
            headers would in the general case scale with the square of the
            number of nodes.  This is a lot of resource for a constrained
            nodes on a constrained network. In the end, the IPsec tunnels
            would be providing only BCP38-like origin authentication!
            That is, IPsec provides a transitive guarantee to the tunnel exit point
            that the tunnel entry point did BCP38 on traffic going in.
            Just doing BCP38 origin
            filtering at the entry and exit of the LLN provides a similar level
            amount of security without all the scaling and trust problems of
            using IPsec as RFC2473 suggested.  IPsec is not recommended.
          </t>
          <t>
            An LLN with hostile nodes within it would not be protected against
            impersonation with the LLN by entry/exit filtering.
          </t>

          <t>
            The RH3 header usage described here can be abused in equivalent
            ways (to disguise the origin of traffic and attack other nodes)
            with an IPv6-in-IPv6 header to add the needed RH3
            header. As such, the attacker's RH3 header will not be seen by
            the network until it reaches the end host, which will decapsulate
            it.  An end-host should be suspicious about a RH3 header which
            has additional hops which have not yet been processed, and SHOULD
            ignore such a second RH3 header.
          </t>
          <t>
            In addition, the LLN will likely use <xref
            target="RFC8138" /> to compress the IPv6-in-IPv6
            and RH3 headers. As such, the compressor at the RPL-root will see
            the second RH3 header and MAY choose to discard the packet if the
            RH3 header has not been completely consumed.  A consumed (inert)
            RH3 header could be present in a packet that flows from one LLN,
            crosses the Internet, and enters another LLN.  As per the
            discussion in this document, such headers do not need to be
            removed.  However, there is no case described in this document
            where an RH3 is inserted in a non-storing network on traffic that
            is leaving the LLN, but this document should not preclude such a
            future innovation.  It should just be noted that an incoming RH3
            must be fully consumed, or very carefully inspected.
          </t>
          <t>
            The RPI header, if permitted to enter the LLN, could be used by
            an attacker to change the priority of a packet by selecting a
            different RPLInstanceID, perhaps one with a higher energy cost,
            for instance.  It could also be that not all nodes are reachable
            in an LLN using the default instanceID, but a change of
            instanceID would permit an attacker to bypass such filtering.
            Like the RH3, a RPI header is to be inserted by the RPL root on
            traffic entering the LLN by first inserting an IPv6-in-IPv6 header. The
            attacker's RPI header therefore will not be seen by the network.
            Upon reaching the destination node the RPI header has no further
            meaning and is just skipped; the presence of a second RPI header
            will have no meaning to the end node as the packet has already
            been identified as being at it's final destination.
          </t>
          <t>
            The RH3 and RPI headers could be abused by an attacker inside of
            the network to route packets on non-obvious ways, perhaps eluding
            observation.   This usage is in fact part of
            <xref target="RFC6997" /> and can not be restricted at all. This
            is a feature, not a bug.
          </t>
          <t>
            <xref target="RFC7416"/> deals with many other threats to LLNs
            not directly related to the use of IPv6-in-IPv6 headers, and this
            document does not change that analysis.
          </t>
          <t>
            Nodes within the LLN can use the IPv6-in-IPv6 mechanism to mount an
            attack on another part of the LLN, while disguising the origin of
            the attack.  The mechanism can even be abused to make it appear
            that the attack is coming from outside the LLN, and unless
            countered, this could be used to mount a Distributed Denial Of
            Service attack upon nodes elsewhere in the Internet. See <xref
            target="DDOS-KREBS" /> for an example of such attacks already
            seen in the real world.
          </t>
          <t>
            If an attack comes from inside of LLN, it can be alleviated with SAVI
            (Source Address Validation Improvement) using <xref target="RFC8505"/> with
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-ap-nd"/>. The attacker will not
            be able to source traffic with an address that is not registered, and the registration process
            checks for topological correctness. Notice that there is an L2 authentication
            in most of the cases.  If an attack comes from outside LLN IPv6-in-
            IPv6 can be used to hide inner routing headers, but by construction, the RH3 can typically only address nodes within the
            LLN.  That is, a RH3 with a CmprI less than 8 , should be considered an attack (see RFC6554, section 3).
          </t>
          <t>
            Nodes outside of the LLN will need to pass IPv6-in-IPv6 traffic
            through the RPL root to perform this attack. To counter, the RPL
            root SHOULD either restrict ingress of IPv6-in-IPv6 packets (the
            simpler solution), or it SHOULD walk the IP header extension chain until it can inspect the
            upper-layer-payload as described in <xref target="RFC7045" />.
            In particular, the RPL root SHOULD do <xref
            target="BCP38" /> processing on the source addresses of all IP
            headers that it examines in both directions.
          </t>
          <t>
            Note: there are some situations where a prefix will spread
            across multiple LLNs via mechanisms such as the one described in
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router" />.
            In this case the BCP38 filtering needs to take this into account,
            either by exchanging detailed routing information on each LLN,
            or by moving the BCP38 filtering further towards the Internet,
            so that the details of the multiple LLNs do not matter.
